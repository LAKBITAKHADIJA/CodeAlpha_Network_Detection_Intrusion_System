# CodeAlpha_Network_Detection_Intrusion_System
To develop a network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) using Suricata on Kali Linux, here are the steps you can follow:

1. Install Suricata on Kali Linux
Start by installing Suricata:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install suricata
2. Configure Suricata
Youâ€™ll need to define rules and configure Suricata to monitor network traffic. Start by editing the configuration file:
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

Ensure Suricata is monitoring the correct interface. Find the interface setting and update it to match your network:

af-packet:
-interface: eth0
  
# Replace 'eth0' with the appropriate interface

3. Set Up IDS Rules
Suricata uses rules to detect specific traffic patterns. You can download community rules from Emerging Threats:

sudo suricata-update
You can also create custom rules. For example, a simple rule to detect incoming pings:

alert icmp any any -> any any (msg: "ICMP Ping detected"; sid:100001;)
Save the custom rule in /etc/suricata/rules/local.rules.

4. Start Suricata
After setting up the rules and configuration, start Suricata in IDS mode:

sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i eth0
5. Monitor and Log Alerts
Suricata logs alerts and events to the /var/log/suricata/ directory. You can monitor the log files using tail:

tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log
6. Visualizing Attacks
To visualize the detected attacks, you can use Kibana with Elasticsearch or Grafana to create dashboards. I
nstall Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) on your Kali system:

Install Elasticsearch:
sudo apt-get install elasticsearch

Install Kibana:
sudo apt-get install kibana

Suricata can be configured to send logs to Logstash for further processing. Once Kibana is set up, create visualizations and dashboards to monitor traffic patterns, suspicious activities, and alerts in real time.
